# gmat - An R package for simulating covariance and concentration graph matrices
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/irenecrsn/gmat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/irenecrsn/gmat)

## Requirements
- R package `igraph`

## Installation instructions
Probably the easiest way to install the package until it is available on CRAN is
to use the R package `devtools`:
```R
devtools::install_github(repo = "irenecrsn/gmat")
```

## Main functionality
This package implements the methods described in the paper:
> Córdoba, I., Varando, G., Bielza, C. and Larrañaga, P.
> A partial orthogonalization method for simulating covariance and concentration graph matrices
> PGM 2018, Accepted.

It is governed by two main functions, `port` and `diagdom`, which take as input an undirected
graph structure `ug` and a sample size `N`, and generates `N`
covariance/concentration matrices subject to the zeros imposed by the undirected
graph structure `ug`.

The sample is generated by `port` with the method described in the above
paper. The classical diagonal dominance
method is the one used by function `diagdom`.

## An example of use

First, we generate a random graph with `3` nodes and density `0.25`, using the
`igraph` package. Then we generate, using our `gmat::port` function, `3` matrices
consistent with such random graphical structure.

```R
> ug <- igraph::sample_gnp(n = 3, p = 0.25)
> matrices <- gmat::port(N = 3, ug = ug)
> matrices
, , 1

         [,1]      [,2]     [,3]
[1,] 1.679735 0.0000000 1.497825
[2,] 0.000000 0.2917888 0.000000
[3,] 1.497825 0.0000000 1.336177

          [,1]      [,2]      [,3]
[1,] 0.5227167 0.0000000 0.7605577
[2,] 0.0000000 0.0348654 0.0000000
[3,] 0.7605577 0.0000000 1.1388367

, , 3

          [,1]      [,2]      [,3]
[1,] 1.8866349 0.0000000 0.9017342
[2,] 0.0000000 0.0017455 0.0000000
[3,] 0.9017342 0.0000000 0.5446746
```

We apprieciate how the zero pattern is shared by all of the
simulated matrices. The return value is an array, and so the individual matrices
can be accessed as `matrices[, , n]`, where `n` is the index of the matrix we
want to retrieve from the sample, ranging from `1` to `N`.
