## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Converted the arXiv link in the description file to format <arXiv:YYMM.NNNNN>
* Added more author metadata in the description using Authors@R

## Test environments
* Local Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS, R 3.4.4
* Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (on travis-ci), R 3.5.0, R devel and R 3.4.4
* macOS Sierra 10.12.6 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.0, R devel and R 3.4.4
* win-builder (devel, release and oldrelease)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There is one NOTE informing about the maintainer and stating that the submission
is new. 

There is also an indication of possible misspelled words (CÃ³rdoba, et, al,
arXiv), which are all false positives.

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
