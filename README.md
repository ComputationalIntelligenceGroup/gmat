# gmat
An R package for simulating covariance and concentration graph matrices.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/irenecrsn/gmat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/irenecrsn/gmat)

This package implements the methods described in the paper:
> Córdoba, I., Varando, G., Bielza, C. and Larrañaga, P.
> A partial orthogonalization method for simulating covariance and concentration graph matrices
> PGM 2018, Accepted.

It is governed by two main functions, `port` and `diagdom`, which take as input an undirected
graph structure `ug` and a sample size `N`, and generates `N`
covariance/concentration matrices subject to the zeros imposed by the undirected
graph structure `ug`.

The sample is generated by `port` with the method described in the above
paper. The classical diagonal dominance
method is the one used by function `diagdom`.

## Installation

Probably the easiest way to install the package until it is available on CRAN is
to use the R package `devtools`:


```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("irenecrsn/gmat")
```

The only R package required for `gmat` is `igraph`, which can be installed
directly from CRAN.

## An example of use 

First, we generate a random graph with `3` nodes and density `0.25`, using the
`igraph` package. Then we generate, using our `gmat::port` function, `3` matrices
consistent with such random graphical structure.



```r
library("igraph")
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'igraph'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     decompose, spectrum
#> The following object is masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     union
library("gmat")
ug <- igraph::sample_gnp(n = 3, p = 0.25)
matrices <- gmat::port(N = 3, ug = ug)
matrices
#> , , 1
#> 
#>           [,1]      [,2]      [,3]
#> [1,] 0.1411399 0.0000000 0.1919509
#> [2,] 0.0000000 0.5438698 0.0000000
#> [3,] 0.1919509 0.0000000 0.2675413

#> [1,] 1.713990 0.0000000 1.274558
#> [2,] 0.000000 0.0993825 0.000000
#> [3,] 1.274558 0.0000000 1.292986
#> 
#> , , 3
#> 
#>           [,1]      [,2]      [,3]
#> [1,] 0.8565504 0.0000000 0.8368169
#> [2,] 0.0000000 0.1049726 0.0000000
#> [3,] 0.8368169 0.0000000 0.8223150
```

We apprieciate how the zero pattern is shared by all of the
simulated matrices. The return value is an array, and so the individual matrices
can be accessed as `matrices[, , n]`, where `n` is the index of the matrix we
want to retrieve from the sample, ranging from `1` to `N`.
