This package implements the methods described in the papers:

### Simulation constrained to undirected graph models

It is governed by two main functions, `port` and `diagdom`, which take as input an undirected graph structure `ug` and a sample size `N`, and generates `N` covariance/concentration matrices subject to the zeros imposed by the undirected graph structure `ug`.

The sample is generated by `port` with the method described in Córdoba et al. (2018a). The classical diagonal dominance method is the one used by function `diagdom`.

### Simulation constrained to acyclic digraph models

The function `rgbn_chol` implements the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm described in the Córdoba et al. (2018b), while `rgbn_polar` implements the polar parametrization method by Pouhramadi and Wang (2015). Both methods are described for correlation matrices, but have been adapted for allowing also an input acyclic digraph.

Installation
------------

The package is available on `CRAN`, to get the latest stable version use:

``` r
install.packages("gmat")
```

The current version on `CRAN` only includes the methods for undirected graph models (Córdoba et al., 2018a).

Alternatively, using the R package `devtools` one may install the development version:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("irenecrsn/gmat")
```

The only R package required for `gmat` is `igraph`, which can also be installed from CRAN.

An example of use
-----------------

First, we generate a random graph with `3` nodes and density `0.25`, using the `igraph` package. Then we generate, using our `gmat::port` function, `3` matrices consistent with such random graphical structure.

``` r
ug <- igraph::sample_gnp(n = 3, p = 0.25)
matrices <- gmat::port(N = 3, ug = ug)
matrices
#> , , 1
#> 
#>           [,1]      [,2]      [,3]
#> [1,] 1.0269390 0.6705653 0.0000000
#> [2,] 0.6705653 1.6862616 0.0000000
#> [3,] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0048852

#> [3,] 0.000000 0.000000 0.5208406

#> [1,] 0.1998933 0.2059904 0.0000000
#> [2,] 0.2059904 1.3606582 0.0000000
#> [3,] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.3093177
```

We apprieciate how the zero pattern is shared by all of the simulated matrices. The return value is an array, and so the individual matrices can be accessed as `matrices[, , n]`, where `n` is the index of the matrix we want to retrieve from the sample, ranging from `1` to `N`.
